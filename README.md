# Photo based blog website.

In this project, I will be implementing some slick React front end skills with a standard Spring Boot backend.
The blogs will be stored in a MySQL database, with URL linked photos being the showpiece of some slick animation on the Front end side.

I am trying to test how creatively I can think with how to display this tried and true social media format.

# Technologies used thusfar:
Currently only Spring Boot 3 and React Native are being used.
There are some other libraries and technologies that I might think of implementing in the future depending on the direction of the project.

I hope to keep updating this with newer and better iterations in the process of discovering other things to implement.
